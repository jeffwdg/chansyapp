# Java Hello World Sample

This project contains a simple servlet application.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/java-helloworld)

## Running the application using the command-line

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application locally:

1. Execute full Maven build to create the `target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war` file:
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. Download and install Liberty, then use it to run the built application from step 1:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

    Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp](http://localhost:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp).

Use the following command to run the built application in Bluemix:
    ```bash
    $ cf push <appname> -p target/JavaHelloWorldApp.war
    ```
## Developing and Deploying using Eclipse

IBM速 Eclipse Tools for Bluemix速 provides plug-ins that can be installed into an existing Eclipse environment to assist in integrating the developer's integrated development environment (IDE) with Bluemix.

1. Download and install  [IBM Eclipse Tools for Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/tools-IBM_Eclipse_Tools_for_Bluemix).

2. Import this sample into Eclipse using `File` -> `Import` -> `Maven` -> `Existing Maven Projects` option.

3. Create a Liberty server definition:
  - In the `Servers` view right-click -> `New` -> `Server`
  - Select `IBM` -> `WebSphere Application Server Liberty`
  - Choose `Install from an archive or a repository`
  - Enter a destination path (/Users/username/liberty)
  - Choose `WAS Liberty with Java EE 7 Web Profile`
  - Continue the wizard with default options to Finish

4. Run your application locally on Liberty:
  - Right click on the `JavaHelloWorldApp` sample and select `Run As` -> `Run on Server` option
  - Find and select the localhost Liberty server and press `Finish`
  - In a few seconds, your application should be running at http://localhost:9080/JavaHelloWorldApp/

5. Create a Bluemix server definition:
  - In the `Servers` view, right-click -> `New` -> `Server`
  - Select `IBM` -> `IBM Bluemix` and follow the steps in the wizard.\
  - Enter your credentials and click `Next`
  - Select your `org` and `space` and click `Finish`

6. Run your application on Bluemix:
  - Right click on the `JavaHelloWorldApp` sample and select `Run As` -> `Run on Server` option
  - Find and select the `IBM Bluemix` and press `Finish`
  - A wizard will guide you with the deployment options. Be sure to choose a unique `Name` for your application
  - In a few minutes, your application should be running at the URL you chose.

This README.md file is displayed on your project page. You should edit this 
file to describe your project, including instructions for building and 
running the project, pointers to the license under which you are making the 
project available, and anything else you think would be useful for others to
know.

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We 
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the 
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

Be sure to update your project's profile with a short description and 
eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give 
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
